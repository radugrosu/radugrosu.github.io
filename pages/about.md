I've trained as a Structural Engineer and worked as a Structural Designer, first at a French multinational, and afterwards at my own company. Around 2012 I've discoverd Peter's Norvig's blog and fell in love with Python. That rabbit hole lead to me completing a Data Science Masters this fall, at King's College.

I'm passionate about learning and about using Science to make our lives better. It feels like the opportunity has never been greater for any individual to make their contribution - whether it's about furthering human knowledge, improving the human condition generally or finding inefficient equity pricings. Perhaps not all at the same time, but you get the idea.

I'm currently living in London looking for a job as a Machine Learning researcher. I'll be blogging here about all cool stuff I'm learning about. I'm going to try to keep things real, and mostly technical.
