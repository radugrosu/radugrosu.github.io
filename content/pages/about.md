I've trained as a Structural Engineer and worked as a Structural Designer, first at a French multinational, and afterwards at my own company. Around 2012 I discovered Peter's Norvig's [blog](norvig.com) and fell in love with Python. That rabbit hole lead to me completing a Data Science Masters this fall, at King's College in London.

I'm passionate about learning and about using Science to make our lives better. It feels like the opportunity has never been greater for any individual to make their contribution - whether it's about furthering human knowledge, improving the human condition or finding inefficiencies in equity pricings and betting markets. Well, perhaps not the last point. That tends to disprove the human condition. But yeah, it's a great time. 

I'm currently living in London looking for a job as a Machine Learning researcher. I'll be blogging here about all the cool stuff I'm learning about along the way. I'm going to try to keep things $\in \mathbb{R}$, and mostly technical. Any hint of sarcasm will be involuntary.
